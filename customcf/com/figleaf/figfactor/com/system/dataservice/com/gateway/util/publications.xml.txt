measurement effort.  The purpose of this effort was to use a
NSIT-developed ultrawideband measurement system to assess
the time and frequency-domain characteristics of selected
ultrawideband transmitting devices.  Brief descriptions of
NIST-developed measurement systems are provided
High-fidelity time-domain waveforms are shown, along with
associated amplitude spectra for two devices.</abstract><date_published>2001-10-21 00:00:00.0</date_published><last_modified></last_modified><pub_id>5</pub_id><r>2</r><title>Time-Domain Measurement System to Characterize Ultrawideband Emissions</title></row><row><abstract>We have systematically compared the results of an extensive ensemble of  the most advanced available quantum-mechanical capacitance-voltage simulation and analysis packages for a range of metal-oxide-semiconductor device parameters.  While all have similar trends accounting for polysilicon depletion and quantum-mechanical confinement, quantitatively, there is difference of up to 20% in the calculated accumulation capacitance for devices with ultra-thin gate dielectrics.  This discrepancy leads to large inaccuracies in the values of dielectric thickness extracted from capacitance measurements and illustrates the importance of consistency during capacitance-voltage analysis and the need to fully report how such analysis is done.</abstract><date_published>2001-01-01 00:00:00.0</date_published><last_modified></last_modified><pub_id>16</pub_id><r>3</r><title>A Comparison of Quantum-Mechanical Capacitance-Voltage Simulators</title></row><row><abstract>The NIST calibration service that provides electric energy traceability for the U.S. utility industry is described.  Electronic watthour meters, submitted for test, are measured using the NIST Power Bridge, in which complex ac power is defined in terms of the more basic units of voltage, resistance, and capacitance.   By integrating power over a known time period, the unit of energy is defined.  Calibrations are performed using a synthetic loading technique at power levels between 0 and 60 kW.  The basic uncertainty of the NIST Power Bridge is about 15 ppm at 120 V,  5 A, 0 to 1.0 power factor, at 60 Hz.  However, calibration uncertainties depend on the power level and the instrument type.  Typical uncertainties (k=2) are between 50 and 500 parts per million.   A Measurement Assurance Program for 60 Hz energy is also available.</abstract><date_published>1998-07-01 00:00:00.0</date_published><last_modified></last_modified><pub_id>19</pub_id><r>4</r><title>Power and Energy Measurements at NIST</title></row><row><abstract></abstract><date_published>1996-01-01 00:00:00.0</date_published><last_modified></last_modified><pub_id>41</pub_id><r>5</r><title>Evidence for Inelastic Processes for N3+ and N4+ from Ion Energy Distributions in He/N2 Radio Frequency Glow Discharges</title></row><row><abstract></abstract><date_published>1971-11-01 00:00:00.0</date_published><last_modified></last_modified>

The procedure is unique because we make the measurements in the time-domain using a calibrated oscilloscope and we then apply frequency domain mismatch corrections to remove the effects of the fixture, bias tee, and cables from the measurements. WE demonstrate the procedure on photodiodes with an active region of approximately 150 m diameter excited by short 800 nm optical pulses.</abstract><date_published>2001-09-01 00:00:00.0</date_published><last_modified></last_modified><pub_id>74</pub_id><r>9</r><title>Measuring the Frequency Response of Gigabit Chip Photodiodes</title></row><row><abstract></abstract><date_published>1988-12-01 00:00:00.0</date_published><last_modified></last_modified><pub_id>100</pub_id><r>10</r><title>A Lithographic SEM Magnification Standard</title></row><row><abstract></abstract><date_published>1987-04-01 00:00:00.0</date_published><last_modified></last_modified><pub_id>103</pub_id><r>11</r><title>A Simple Technique for Investigating Defects in Coaxial Connectors</title></row><row><abstract></abstract><date_published>1977-05-01 00:00:00.0</date_published><last_modified></last_modified><pub_id>118</pub_id><r>12</r><title>Measurement Procedures for the Optical Beam Splitter Attenuation Device BA-1</title></row><row><abstract>Since 1994 a bank of four 10 pF oil-bath type fused-silica dielectric capacitors has been maintained in the NIST Impedance Calibration Laboratory for use as reference standards to assign values to the secondary reference and check standards used for performing calibrations on customer's standards.  The values of the reference standards in this bank are determined via comparisons with a 10 pF air-bath type fused-silica capacitor from the NIST primary capacitance laboratory.  This laboratory maintains the U. S. capacitance unit in a primary bank of 10 pF oil-bath type, fused-silica dielectric capacitors, traceable to the NIST calculable capacitor.  The database for these reference standards is now established and the algorithms for maintaining their values with statistical prediction methods are developed.  Also discussed is a preliminary investigation of the frequency dependence of the transfer standard, which significantly affects the present capacitance calibration uncertainties.</abstract><date_published>1998-07-01 00:00:00.0</date_published><last_modified></last_modified><pub_id>123</pub_id><r>13</r><title>Recent Developments in the Capacitance Calibration Services at the National Institute of Standards and Technology</title></row><row><abstract></abstract><date_published>1987-12-01 00:00:00.0</date_published><last_modified></last_modified><pub_id>146</pub_id><r>14</r><title>Spherical-Wave Source-Scattering Matrix Analysis of Coupled Antennas; A General System Two-Port Solution</title></row><row><abstract>A plane wave integral representation is presented for well-stirred fields in a reverberation chamber.  The representation automatically satisfies Maxwell's equations in a source-free region and the statistical properties of the fields are introduced through the angular spectrum, which is taken to be a random  variable.  Starting with fairly simple and physically appropriate assumptions for the angular spectrum a number of properties of the electric and magnetic fields and the power received by an antenna or a test object are derived.  Many of these properties and test object responses are in agreement with other theories or with measured results.  An important result for radiated immunity testing is that the ensemble (stirring) average fo received power is equal to the average over plane wave incidence and polarization.</abstract><date_published>1998-08-01 00:00:00.0</date_published><last_modified></last_modified><pub_id>156</pub_id><r>15</r><title>Plane Wave Integral Representation for Fields in Reverberation Chambers</title></row><row><abstract>I use the direct far-field method to measure the mode-field diameter of a single-mode fiber with an expand uncertainty of 30 nm, with a coverage factor of 2.  For a step-index fiber with a mode-field diameter of approximately 9 5m, the major sources of uncertainty are nonlinearity in the electronics, angular errors and scattered light in the apparatus, and the polarization and noncircularity of the mode of the fiber.  The paper concludes by showing an inconsistency in the derivation of the far-field expression for mode-field diameter.</abstract><date_published>1998-12-20 00:00:00.0</date_published><last_modified></last_modified><pub_id>160</pub_id><r>16</r><title>Mode-Field Diameter of Single-Mode Optical Fiber by Far-Field Scanning:  Addendum</title></row><row><abstract></abstract><date_published>1997-11-01 00:00:00.0</date_published><last_modified></last_modified><pub_id>169</pub_id><r>17</r><title>Maker Fringe Analysis of Z-Cut Lithium Niobate</title></row><row><abstract>Operating margins for biolar superconducting voltage waveform synthesizer were measured.

The 'com' directory contains the current version of the framework.

The 'org' directory contains the original V1 code base.

All future development should happen in the 'com' directory.

Only future bug fixes will continue in the 'org' directory. Currently the 'org' directory contains the production code base which is driving www.nist.gov and several US senators web sites.
